Description:
    The purpose of authentication zero is to generate a pre-built
    authentication system into a rails application that
    follows both security and rails best practices.

    By generating code into the user's application
    instead of using a library, the user has complete freedom
    to modify the authentication system so it works best with their app.

Example:
    bin/rails generate authentication
